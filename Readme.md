  `mad(1)` is a markdown driven manual page viewer,
  this makes manuals easier to _write_, _reuse_, and
  _read_.

## About

  I _love_ man pages, however they are annoying to write by hand,
  and often converted from markdown documentation. Also `man` in my
  opinion does a poor job of displaying the information, the whitespace
  makes them difficult to read. `mad(1)` is effectively the idea, but
  write your manuals in markdown like you would anyway, re-use them
  in your github readmes, wikis, or use markdown to HTML conversion
  tools.
